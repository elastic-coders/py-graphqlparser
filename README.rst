Graphql parser based  on libgraphqlparser
=========================================

Python2.7+ Python3.4+ class-based bindings to libgraphqlparser

See usage example in `examples/visitor_example.py`

Still **EXPERIMENTAL**


Installing
----------

Prerequisites:

- Install ``cython``
- Download and build ``libgraphqlparser``


Install using pip

- set an env var ``$GRAPHQL_HOME`` to the folder where libgraphqlparser is
- ``LDFLAGS="-L$GRAPHQL_HOME" CFLAGS="-I$GRAPHQL_HOME/c -I$GRAPHQL_HOME" pip install graphqlparser``


Building from source
--------------------

Needed to rebuild the generate cython files from the libgraphql AST

- download submodules with ``git checkout --recursive``
- build libgraphql library in folder ``./libgraphqlparser`` (python2.7 required for building)
  (usually ``pushd libgraphqlparser && cmake . && make && popd`` works)
- generate source code with ``python ast/build_ast.py``
- you can now switch to python 3
- install ``cython``
- run ``LDFLAGS="-L./libgraphqlparser" CFLAGS="-Ilibgraphqlparser/c -Ilibgraphqlparser" python setup.py build_ext``

To package with wheel:
- install wheel: ``pip install wheel``
- create wheelhouse ``mkdir .wheelhouse``
- build with ``pip wheel --wheel-dir=.wheelhouse .``


Run
---

Make sure ``libgraphqlparser`` is available to the loader. You can add its base dir to  ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.


Known issues
------------

- Only (lightly) tested on python3
- Unicode string handling not yet complete (a mixture of bytes and strings all over)
- Exceptions in the visitor's class callbacks are ignored
- libgraphqlparser is **dynamically** linked but It would be better if it was linked statically


TODO
----

- make wheels available on github
- build more wheel packages for linux 32 bit and other platforms
